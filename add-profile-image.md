# Adding Your Profile Image

To add your profile image to the site:

1. Save the profile image you uploaded as `static/images/profile.jpg`
2. The image should be approximately 200x200 pixels for best results
3. The site is already configured to use this image in `config.yml`

## Manual Steps:
1. Right-click on the profile image you uploaded in the chat
2. Save it as `profile.jpg` in the `static/images/` directory
3. Commit and push the changes

The site will automatically use this image for your profile picture.
